             <h3>One of my favourite quotes by Oprah Winfrey:</h3>
                <em> "Wherever you are in your journey, I hope you, too, will keep encountering challenges. It is a blessing to be able to survive them, to be able to keep putting one foot in front of the other--to be in a position to make the climb up life's mountain, knowing that the summit still lies ahead".</em>
